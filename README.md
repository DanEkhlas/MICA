# MICA

MICA is a workflow for minimal inhibitory concentration analysis. The goal of this workflow is to allow users the easy assessment of antimicrobial resistance profiles of their lab strains.

Currently supported assay formats:

- **Plate size:**                               96-well plates
- **Antimicrobial concentrations (columns):**   2-fold and customizable
- **Assay layout:**                             multiple strains & one antimicrobial 
                                                one strain & multiple antimicrobials
